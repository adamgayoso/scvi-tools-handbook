This document uses the following conventions when depicting graphical models:

- Shaded vertices represent observed random variables.
- Half-shaded vertices represent variables that can be either observed or random. Empty vertices represent latent random variables.
- Edges signify conditional dependency.
- Rectangles (``plates'') represent independent replication.
